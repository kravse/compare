This is a little compare site, that displays and compares images. 

This was an experiment with handlebars and jquery hashchange to see if I could whip up a super minimal single page site. 


Instructions: 

1) In the project root, run 'npm install'

2) Run gulp to compile all static assets from 'src' into their build destinations. 

3) Optional: Run gulp watch to poll for changes.
